# ThisOrThat-app
A mobile game built with [NativeScript](http://www.nativescript.org) leveraging the [Clarifai API](http://clarifai.com/)

ThisOrThat, a Game of Words and Tags, is available for download on iOS and Android here: 

Powered by the Clarifai API, this game will test your word-association skills!

- pick two pictures, and the Clarifai artificial intelligence mechanism will provide a series of words that will describe the image
- pick from one of twenty languages to create your word tags. This game is a great way to learn new vocabulary in a foreign language!
